/*
 ToDoListDriver provides an interface over two TaskListsâ€”one that represents the outstanding
 tasks and another that represents the completed tasks. It provides functionality such as
 creating a new outstanding task, removing a specific outstanding task, marking a specific
 outstanding task as complete, and outputting the outstanding/completed tasks in
 non-detailed/detailed manners.
